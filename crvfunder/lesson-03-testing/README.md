# CRVFunder 3: Testing

## [ðŸŽ¥ Video 3: Testing ðŸŽ¬](https://youtu.be/60eKVjjUJ0c)

The CRVFunder series is a short series exploring using Brownie at an application level.  Specifically, we'll be looking at how Brownie was used to help rapidly prototype the CRVFunder application.  CRVFunder launched a new fundraising gauge type to divert CRV inflation to any cause as voted on by the Curve DAO.

Throughout this series we'll be pointing to snapshots of the code in development.  The actual repository is available at [@vefunder/crvfunder](https://github.com/vefunder/crvfunder/).  The code contained here in the crvfunder directory shows the application snapshot as it existed at [63b4041](https://github.com/vefunder/crvfunder/commit/63b4041ff06ff6ea943a7d69ae233719c4411bbd)
