# CRVFunder Series

The CRVFunder series is a short series exploring using Brownie at an application level.  These lessons presume a basic understanding of Brownie, so it is recommended you have completed at least lessons 1-7 of the primary Brownie tutorial before attempting these lessons.

This lesson performs a deep dive into how Brownie was used to help rapidly prototype the CRVFunder application.  CRVFunder launched a new fundraising gauge type to divert CRV inflation to any cause as voted on by the Curve DAO.  

All code in this lesson contains historical shapshots from the code in development from the application.  The actual repository is available at [@vefunder/crvfunder](https://github.com/vefunder/crvfunder/).  Each folder contains a commit snapshot hash along with a matching snapshot of the code.
