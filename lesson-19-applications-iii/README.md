# Applications III: Curve Reward tAPY

## [ðŸŽ¥ Video 19: Applications III ðŸŽ¬](https://youtu.be/usZ8SXMY6iA)

Sample application: Calculate Curve estimated Reward tAPY from on-chain data.


### CURVE tAPY CALCULATION

        > tAPY = (crv_price * inflation_rate * relative_weight * 12614400) / (working_supply * asset_price * virtual_price)

### CURVE REWARDS
Each week veCRV holders vote on which pools should receive the most Curve rewards.  The value fluctuates and is not guaranteed, so precise on-chain calculation is useful.  Details at [https://dao.curve.fi/](https://dao.curve.fi/)


### CURVE INFLATION

Curve has a preset inflation schedule for the next several centuries.  This emissions rate is a callable function of the $CRV token.
